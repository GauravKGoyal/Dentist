1 DONE Bug - Saving a doctor fails to save address 

Knowledge to remember
1 - Lazy context will create object using proxy therefore initialization of properties in the constructor will be ignored. However read context will not ignore this
when creating an new object using lazy loading you have to make sure that lists are initialized whereas when updating an existing object list should not be initialized
2 - Domain Modelling
3 - How EF gets us away from domain modelling by making collection public, having Ids 
4 - Generic Controller with Generic Views
5 - Ef doesnt load virtual objects during validations
6 - Ef difference between Dbset.Create and DbSet.Add -> Dbset.Create -> creates an proxy object where as add method just adds the object to the context which it gets. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9261890/added-code-first-entity-doesnt-lazy-load-properties/9262111#9262111
7 - Circular reference objects cannot be serialized, therefore i failed to serialized ef objects as their parent knows about child and child knows about parent. This is one of the reason i have introduced view model objects or dtos
