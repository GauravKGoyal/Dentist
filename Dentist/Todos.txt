1 DONE Bug - Saving a doctor fails to save address 

Knowledge to remember
Lazy context will create object using proxy therefore initialization of properties in the constructor will be ignored. However read context will not ignore this
when creating an new object using lazy loading you have to make sure that lists are initialized whereas when updating an existing object list should not be initialized
